Create a simple Java Spring Boot backend application for a Product Management system. The application will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Product entity using MySQL as the database. The backend must be well-structured following the standard multi-layered architecture:

Controller

Service

Repository

DTO

Model

Exception handling

Configuration

Additionally, include JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for securing the API.

Technical Stack:

Java 17+

Spring Boot

Spring Data JPA

Spring Security with JWT

MySQL

Maven

Lombok (optional but preferred)

RESTful APIs

Swagger

Backend API Requirements (CRUD):

GET /products – Retrieve a list of all products

POST /products – Add a new product

PUT /products/{id} – Update an existing product

DELETE /products/{id} – Delete a product

JWT Integration Requirements:

Implement JWT-based login \& token generation

Secure the product CRUD endpoints to require a valid JWT token

Public endpoints (e.g., /auth/login, /auth/register)

Protect /products/\*\* endpoints with JWT

Use Spring Security Filters and custom UserDetailsService

Folder Structure (Recommended)

src/main/java/com/example/productapp/

│

├── controller/

├── service/

├── repository/

├── model/

├── dto/

├── config/

├── security/

├── exception/

└── ProductApplication.java

This is context and basic idea for you. Just remember this.

Now I will give you prompt one by one. By the reference perform the task. If you have any doubt before proceeding you can ask.

##### 2

src/main/java/com/example/

Under this there should be only SpringBootApplication.java and next for each layer create package or folder:

productcontroller.java

productservice.java

ProductRepository.java

likewise

##### 3

Create a Product entity with fields:

id (Long)

name (String)

description (String)

price (Double)

createdDate (LocalDateTime)

Use JPA annotations.

Under model package.

##### 4

Create a ProductDTO class under dto package with the same fields as Product, excluding database annotations.

##### 5

Create a repository interface ProductRepository that extends JpaRepository<Product, Long>.

##### 6

Create a ProductService class implementing CRUD methods using ProductRepository.

##### 7

Create a ProductController class exposing REST endpoints for CRUD operations using ProductService.

##### 8

Implement Spring Security with JWT-based authentication. Create login and register endpoints, generate JWT token on login, and secure other endpoints using JWT filter.

##### 9

For note – Yes, configure Spring Security to allow access to /auth/\*\* endpoints and require authentication for /products/\*\* endpoints using JWT.

##### 10

Create a GlobalExceptionHandler class to handle exceptions like ProductNotFoundException and validation errors.

##### 11

I think the project structure is not as Spring Boot application and it might create issue or error while running or while compiling so make structure for

Spring Boot 3 project with the following dependencies:

Spring Web

Spring Data JPA

Spring Security

Lombok

MySQL

and anything more needed?

##### 12

Correct. Add these things and it should be error-free.

##### 13

If I run this Spring Boot app will it return any error?

##### 14

Once check all main files and also check code quality. I want to add SonarQube.

##### 15

Add SonarQube plugin/configuration to pom.xml?

Provide a SonarQube setup guide?

Yes for all these 3.

##### 16

From Spring Tool Suite when I run this project it is giving me error like:

selection does not contain main type

##### 17

Now my project is working. Tell me to check the output what should be the exact flow. Tell me which API, which data, and in which format in Postman I am going to run.

##### 18

{

&nbsp; "error": "Handler dispatch failed: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/DatatypeConverter"

}

##### 19

{

&nbsp; "id": 1,

&nbsp; "name": "Laptop",

&nbsp; "description": "A high-end gaming laptop",

&nbsp; "price": 1500.0,

&nbsp; "createdDate": null

}

It is working but created date or time should be taken by at the time of sending response not by user. So make sure that created date should be taken automatically not from user.

##### 20

Configure CORS in the backend to allow requests from the Angular frontend.

##### 21

Task: Enhance the existing Spring Boot project (ProductB) to support role-based authentication.
Note: JWT authentication is already implemented, and basic CRUD for the Product entity is functional.

Step 1: Check if a Role system exists in the User model
If not, create a Role enum or entity and add a role field in the User class (e.g., USER, ADMIN)

Step 2: Update the User entity to include a role field
Use either @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING) or a relationship to a separate Role entity

Step 3: Update JWT generation logic to include the user's role in the token
And update JWT parsing logic to extract the role for authorization checks

Step 4: Create a method to secure endpoints based on roles

Admin can perform all CRUD operations on products

User can only create products and can only edit/delete products they created
Use Spring Security’s method-level authorization with @PreAuthorize or access control in the controller

Step 5: Modify the Product entity to associate each product with the user who created it
Add a ManyToOne relationship to User in the Product class with a field like createdBy

Step 6: In ProductController:

On POST /products, save the logged-in user as the creator of the product

On PUT and DELETE, check if the logged-in user is the creator OR has ADMIN role

Step 7: Add method-level security configuration if not already present
Enable @PreAuthorize annotations using @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)

Step 8: Optional - Create a custom AccessDeniedHandler and AuthenticationEntryPoint for proper error messages

Keep all code modular, use standard Spring Security practices, and apply exception handling for unauthorized access

Things are clear or have any doubt
