Create a simple Java Spring Boot backend application for a Product Management system. The application will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Product entity using MySQL as the database. The backend must be well-structured following the standard multi-layered architecture:



Controller



Service



Repository



DTO



Model



Exception handling



Configuration



Additionally, include JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for securing the API.



Technical Stack:



Java 17+



Spring Boot



Spring Data JPA



Spring Security with JWT



MySQL



Maven



Lombok (optional but preferred)



RESTful APIs



Swagger



Backend API Requirements (CRUD):



GET /products – Retrieve a list of all products



POST /products – Add a new product



PUT /products/{id} – Update an existing product



DELETE /products/{id} – Delete a product



JWT Integration Requirements:



Implement JWT-based login \& token generation



Secure the product CRUD endpoints to require a valid JWT token



Public endpoints (e.g., /auth/login, /auth/register)



Protect /products/\*\* endpoints with JWT



Use Spring Security Filters and custom UserDetailsService



Folder Structure (Recommended)



src/main/java/com/example/productapp/

│

├── controller/

├── service/

├── repository/

├── model/

├── dto/

├── config/

├── security/

├── exception/

└── ProductApplication.java



This is context and basic idea for you. Just remember this.

Now I will give you prompt one by one. By the reference perform the task. If you have any doubt before proceeding you can ask.



##### 2

src/main/java/com/example/

Under this there should be only SpringBootApplication.java and next for each layer create package or folder:



productcontroller.java



productservice.java



ProductRepository.java

likewise



##### 3

Create a Product entity with fields:



id (Long)



name (String)



description (String)



price (Double)



createdDate (LocalDateTime)



Use JPA annotations.

Under model package.



##### 4

Create a ProductDTO class under dto package with the same fields as Product, excluding database annotations.



##### 5

Create a repository interface ProductRepository that extends JpaRepository<Product, Long>.



##### 6

Create a ProductService class implementing CRUD methods using ProductRepository.



##### 7

Create a ProductController class exposing REST endpoints for CRUD operations using ProductService.



##### 8

Implement Spring Security with JWT-based authentication. Create login and register endpoints, generate JWT token on login, and secure other endpoints using JWT filter.



##### 9

For note – Yes, configure Spring Security to allow access to /auth/\*\* endpoints and require authentication for /products/\*\* endpoints using JWT.



##### 10

Create a GlobalExceptionHandler class to handle exceptions like ProductNotFoundException and validation errors.



##### 11

I think the project structure is not as Spring Boot application and it might create issue or error while running or while compiling so make structure for

Spring Boot 3 project with the following dependencies:



Spring Web



Spring Data JPA



Spring Security



Lombok



MySQL

and anything more needed?



##### 12

Correct. Add these things and it should be error-free.



##### 13

If I run this Spring Boot app will it return any error?



##### 14

Once check all main files and also check code quality. I want to add SonarQube.



##### 15

Add SonarQube plugin/configuration to pom.xml?

Provide a SonarQube setup guide?

Yes for all these 3.



##### 16

From Spring Tool Suite when I run this project it is giving me error like:

selection does not contain main type



##### 17

Now my project is working. Tell me to check the output what should be the exact flow. Tell me which API, which data, and in which format in Postman I am going to run.



##### 18

{

&nbsp;   "error": "Handler dispatch failed: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/DatatypeConverter"

}



##### 19

{

&nbsp;   "id": 1,

&nbsp;   "name": "Laptop",

&nbsp;   "description": "A high-end gaming laptop",

&nbsp;   "price": 1500.0,

&nbsp;   "createdDate": null

}



It is working but created date or time should be taken by at the time of sending response not by user. So make sure that created date should be taken automatically not from user.



##### 20

Configure CORS in the backend to allow requests from the Angular frontend.
